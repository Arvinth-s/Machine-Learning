# Machine-Learning
Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.
The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide.
The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.
## Some machine learning methods
1. Supervised machine learning algorithms
2. Unsupervised machine learning algorithms
3. Semi-supervised machine learning algorithms
4. Reinforcement machine learning algorithms
## Dig a little deeper
Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed. ML is one of the most exciting technologies that one would have ever come across. As it is evident from the name, it gives the computer that which makes it more similar to humans: The ability to learn. Machine learning is actively being used today, perhaps in many more places than one would expect.
